# Voice-Input-chatbot

This is a demo of a chatbot created using dialogflow CX for a fantasy cricket app. The main features of the chatbot is that it can use voice input and support multilingual understanding. I have used Web to Speech API for the voice input and created this demo in simple html, js and css .

To run the code:
1. clone the github repository
2. Get the access token from Google cloud using (gcloud auth print-access-token) - this is temporary and is valid for 1 hr
3. enter this access token in TOKEN variable in the index.js file.
4. You can run the files using (python3 -m http.server 8000) in the cloud shell
